    "description": "Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers who\njust need virtual private servers. Lightsail includes everything you need to\nlaunch your project quickly - a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data\ntransfer, DNS management, and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You\nmanage those Lightsail servers through the Lightsail console or by using the API\nor command-line interface (CLI).\n\nFor more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the Lightsail Dev\nGuide [https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/all].\n\nTo use the Lightsail API or the CLI, you will need to use AWS Identity and\nAccess Management (IAM) to generate access keys. For details about how to set\nthis up, see the Lightsail Dev Guide\n[http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli]\n.",
